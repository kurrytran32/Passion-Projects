            <p>
                Hello!  We are Kerry Tran and Calvin Wang.  We are current students learning Full Stack Web Development and decided to put whatever we learn from the course into a sort of passion project.  Here, we will talk about places, food and events we will go to and do "personal-opinion" based reviews on what we experience.
            </p> 

            <p>
                We are based out of San Diego, California.  Most restaurants or events we will be reviewing for now will be So-Cal/San Diego based due to our schedule.  
            </p>
